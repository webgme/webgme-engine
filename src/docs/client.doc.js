 *
 * @event Client#CONNECTED_USERS_CHANGED
 * @type {object}
 * @property {string} type - 'BRANCH_ROOM_SOCKETS', 'CLIENT_STATE_NOTIFICATION'
 * @property {string} projectId - The id of the project
 * @property {string} branchName - The name of the branch
 * @property {string} userId - The user-id of the user who joined or left
 * @property {string} socketId - The unique socket-id of the user who joined or left (this can become hashed)
 * @property {boolean|undefined} [join] - Whether or not the user joined or left the room (undefined -> false) this only
 * applies to the 'BRANCH_ROOM_SOCKETS' event.
 * @property {object|null} [state] - This only applies to the
 * 'CLIENT_STATE_NOTIFICATION' event and is defined by the return value of the function passed in at
 * client.registerUIStateGetter. Behind the scenes this emitted by the client when it receives a
 * 'BRANCH_ROOM_SOCKETS' event in order to notify that new client that it has a user in the same room. But can also
 * be emitted from the GUI by invoking client.emitStateNotification() (which is invoked by the generic webgme UI
 * whenever its state changes). The state in the example below is specific for the generic webgme UI.
